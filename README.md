simplePngEx
===========

A Simple libpng Example.


The original C code was repackaged into a C++ class for modularity and ease of use.
The included source code includes Makefiles and a sample png for easy testing.

The simplepng_c directory contains the original C program.
The simplepng_cc directory contains the C++ program.

Compilation depends on libpng and standard C libraries.

The original program was found at http://zarb.org/~gc/html/libpng.html and was written by Guillaume Cottenceau under the X11 license.
